# CustomConfigs
Customizations for a variety of programs.

##General Rules
1. I assume you have the programs listed already installed.
2. Most of these are configured for Windows, but everything should work properly in Linux systems (including Mac). The only exception to this is Rainmeter and Powershell, because Rainmeter is a Windows only program, and Powershell only comes included with Windows.
3. These are all based off the latest versions of their respective programs, as of 1/23/16.
4. Post issues if you find them, it is to everybody's benefit to have a better working configuration for any of these programs.
5. These are all tailored to my personal preference, if you wish to change anything in accordance with your own preferences, nobody's stopping you.
