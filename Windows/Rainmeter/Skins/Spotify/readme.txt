1. Copy all the files to your Rainmeter folder which is inside your Documents folder.
2. Right Click the skin, click on 'Edit skin...' scroll down to [MeterTitle] and "Text=", and and change the value to what you'd like to see when Spotify is not running. 
   (Or you could leave it empty for no text when Spotify is playing)


Thanks for using my Spotify skin :)
