My custom powershell configuration. Includes better tab completion and highlighting, git support, ssh tools, better ls that gets directory size, a funny Get-Excuse method, and a few other various tools.

##Installation
1. Open powershell, and type in the name of your favorite editor followed by "$Profile".
2. For example, if I wanted to use notepad, I would type "notepad $Profile".
3. Append all the text in here to the file that opened. 
4. Save and reopen powershell.
