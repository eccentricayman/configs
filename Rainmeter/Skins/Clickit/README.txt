Disclaimers:

The icons have some.. issues. They were made by me, 
and I haven't really done anything like this before, 
so they're not as pretty as they can be, but they work.

The code, especially that of the button1.ini, is kinda somewhat really bad. 
There are a lot of parts in there that aren't needed, the only problems is that I don't know which parts exactly,
 and this was done quick and dirty with "stolen" code, so it is what it is.
