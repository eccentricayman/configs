My custom RainMeter configuration with two themes. It probably won't scale properly, but if your resolution is 1366x768, or you want a pre-picked group of skins, go for it.

##Usage
1. Find your Rainmeter folder, usually located at ~/Documents/Rainmeter
2. Place the skins folder inside the Rainmeter folder and click overwrite.
3. If you wish to keep your previous Rainmeter configuration, add the skins manually.
4. Do Win + R, and type in "%APPDATA%". In AppData, find the RainMeter folder and move everything inside the layouts folder to your layout folder.
